# Calibration

Calibration uses the 3 buttons on the top of the EPD FeatherWing: A, B, and C, in that order.

Due to the restrictions of the EPD refresh rate, a buzzer is used to provide feedback. In some cases to confirm among multiple options, the buzzer will beep a [morse code][] letter to indicate the option selected. These sequences are indicated as "." for short beeps and "-" for long beeps. Three long beeps indicate an error and that the calibration process has been aborted.

## Starting Calibration

Press the "C" button to begin calibration. The device will beep twice to indicate that calibration mode has been entered.

### Dissolved Oxygen

1. Press "A" to select dissolved oxygen calibration. Device will sound "D" (-..) to indicate dissolved oxygen has been selected.

2. Remove probe from water.

3. Press "A" to take calibration reading. Device will beep once to indicate readings are being taken, and twice when reading has been saved.

4. Place probe in water.

### pH

> pH uses 3-point calibration. Buffer solutions are pH 4, 7, and 10 and are automatically detected.

1. Press "B" to select pH calibration. Device will sound "P" (.--.) to indicate pH has been selected.

2. Rinse probe with distilled/deionized water and place it into one of the buffer solutions.

3. Press "A" to take calibration reading. Device will beep twice when the reading has been taken.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining buffer solutions. The device will beep three times when the calibration points have been saved. Note, if an error occurs no calibration points will be saved.
