This project is very much a work in progress and I'm learning as I go. There probably isn't anything here for you (yet).

## Motivation

Atlas Scientific doesn't make a kit using their low cost sensors or with _just_ the sensors I want. They do make a kit with the (most of the) sensors I want, but it's expensive and I don't need the other stuff in it. Also Open-Source hardware is cool and good and I want to be a part of it.

## Hardware
